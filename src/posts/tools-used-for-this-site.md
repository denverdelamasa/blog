### Tools I used for this blog site (that you should checkout)

I've decided to list some of the websites/online tools that I used/I've been using so you won't have to ask me, or search rigorously

---

### But first, why?

Well, I'm gonna be honest with you, I have nothing to put here. I meant in this blog site...
Though I did say that I'd be yapping a lot here, but anyways, I came up with this topic for the people who might like this site's design and how I did this tiny project. And just decided to look up the things I used to make this *(idk where they'd start tbh)*, or message me directly and I might not be able to reply, so yeah, I will make this, and list the tools I have used 

---

### List Summary *(just in case you're just browsing)*

1. imgbb.com - image hosting site
2. 10015.io - all-in-one design ool 
3. uiverse.io - UI library
4. codepen.io - UI library too
5. spline.design - 3D design platform
6. excalidraw - virtual whiteboard/drawing tool

## 1. imgbb.com

![imgbb.com](https://i.ibb.co/TMSjXHvz/Screenshot-from-2025-10-23-23-16-14.png)

Yeah, imgbb.com, it's a free image hosting site I found on a reddit thread... that's pretty much it. they have their own tutorial so you're better off just looking it up yourself, I suck at explaining.

Although my first encounter of this site was when I was *"sailing the seas"* and looking at sample screenshots... *wink wink*

Matter of fact, all the images in this blog *(except for gallery)* is hosted here. you can check it out by *"right clicking"* the image, and selecting *"Open image in new tab"*

## 2. 10015.io

![10015.io](https://i.ibb.co/GvjPM0VP/Screenshot-from-2025-10-23-23-21-35.png)

Now this is pretty niche and I highly recommend that you guys check it out!

I mostly use this for making CSS backgrounds, I uploaded some of my designs at uiverse.io and codepen.io *(more on that later)*. So yeah, it's pretty much self explanatory, it's an all-in-one online tool that pretty much does the job you need...

## 3. uiverse.io

![uiverse.io](https://i.ibb.co/4nFjB39p/Screenshot-from-2025-10-23-23-23-35.png)

This is a site I've been using for a long time now, it's a UI library where you can look up components you can add to you projects, royalty free, everything is under *MIT License*, so it's all GUCCI! You can also upload you designs by using *HTML & CSS*, *React Component*, *TailwindCSS*, etc...

## 4. codepen.io

![codepen.io](https://i.ibb.co/Z1zZrLx5/Screenshot-from-2025-10-23-23-24-04.png)

Like **uiverse.io**, this is also a component library, with same features such as uploading your designs, but what makes it different is that you can also have javascript here... anyways yes, another component library...

## 5. spline.design

![spline.design](https://i.ibb.co/fY11R2Hj/Screenshot-from-2025-10-23-23-24-58.png)

So... yeah this one's pretty niche as well... it's basically blender running in your browser. you can also embed/export your projects from spline, directly in your code, via react, ThreeJS, etc... *(I haven't actually explored it enough)* so yeah... if you're looking to start learning 3D integrations in your web projects I highly recommend that you check out spline!

## 6. excalidraw.com

![excalidraw.com](https://i.ibb.co/C3xZYfHQ/Screenshot-from-2025-10-23-23-22-24.png)

Lastly, this. It's an online whiteboard tool, that is also versatile, and can be used for various purposes *(I use it mostly for designing websites)*. tbh idk how I could manage to use this as a design tool. Just goes to show you that's it's a really good tool!

I regret that I slept on this I ain't gonna lie, it's a REALLY really good tool, especially for making simplified design, since it's not as complicated as figma, and it's EASY to use... I'd probably use this for the rest of my career... highly recommend this!

### To summarize

Yeah finally I can stop. I think I've yapped all I have to say here. tbh this is kinda fun, I really enjoyed typing here and just say everything I want... what am I saying bro... Anyways, I kinda need to type a lot more professionally in the future... SO YEAH! thank you for reading this, and if you happen to see/learned something useful *(for some reason)*, consider [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/denverdelamasa)!
